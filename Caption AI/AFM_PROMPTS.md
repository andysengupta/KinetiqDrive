# Compare Captions

**User Caption:** "Ears and face"
**AI Caption:** "Close Ear Detail"

## Scoring Rubric (0-10)

**0-3**: Off-topic, generic, or completely misses image content
**4-6**: Partially relevant but bland, vague, or weak connection
**7-8**: Strong alignment with image, specific and clear
**9-10**: Evocative, precise, creative‚Äîcaptures essence perfectly

## Evaluation Categories
- **Relevance**: Does it match the image content?
- **Specificity**: Is it concrete or generic?
- **Fluency**: Is it well-phrased?
- **Originality**: Is it creative or clich√©?

# Task: Judge User Caption

Score the **user's caption** (0-10) based on the rubric above.
Provide 2-3 short, actionable tips for improvement.
List 2-3 category names evaluated (e.g., ["Relevance", "Specificity"]).

Output only the CaptionJudgment structure.
```

### What's Included:
- ‚úÖ Image interpretation for context
- ‚úÖ Both captions (user vs AI)
- ‚úÖ Detailed scoring rubric
- ‚úÖ Evaluation criteria
- ‚úÖ Request for specific output format

### Expected Response:
```json

}
```

### Generation Options:
```swift
temperature: 0.6        // Balanced = fair judging

## üîß **How Prompts Are Built**

### Code Flow:
```swift
// Stage A: Image Interpretation
let prompt = AFMJudge.buildInterpretationPrompt()
// Returns: The markdown prompt above

// Stage B: Caption Generation  
let prompt = AFMJudge.buildCaptionPrompt(interpretation: interp)
// Returns: Markdown with image analysis + caption rules

// Stage C: Judging
let prompt = AFMJudge.buildJudgmentPrompt(
    userCaption: "Ears and face",
    aiCaption: "Close Ear Detail",
    interpretation: interp
)
// Returns: Markdown with analysis + both captions + rubric
```

## üìä **Prompt Characteristics**

| Stage | Token Count | Temperature | Format | Focus |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **A: Interpret** | ~150-200 | 0.3 (factual) | Structured JSON | Visual analysis |
| **B: Caption** | ~200-250 | 0.7 (creative) | Short text | 3-5 words |
| **C: Judge** | ~300-400 | 0.6 (balanced) | Structured scoring | Fair evaluation |

---

## üéØ **Key Design Principles**

### 1. **Markdown Formatting**
All prompts use markdown for clarity:
- `#` Headers for sections
- `**Bold**` for emphasis
- `-` Lists for structure
- Code blocks for examples

### 2. **Structured Output Requests**
Each prompt asks for specific JSON-like structures:
- `ImageInterpretation`
- `AICaption`
- `CaptionJudgment`

### 3. **Progressive Context**
- Stage A: Just image
- Stage B: Image interpretation
- Stage C: Image interpretation + both captions

### 4. **Clear Constraints**
- Word counts (3-5 words)
- Format rules (Title Case)
- Scoring ranges (0-10)
- Safety considerations

```swift
// Add debug prints in AFMService.swift before session.respond()
print("üì§ Sending prompt to AFM:")
print(prompt)
print("---")

## üí° **Why These Prompts Work**

### ‚úÖ **Clear Instructions**
- Tells AI exactly what to do
- Provides examples
- Specifies output format

### ‚úÖ **Structured Thinking**
- Breaks down image analysis into categories
- Separates concerns (objects, scene, vibes)
- Progressive refinement (interpret ‚Üí caption ‚Üí judge)

### ‚úÖ **Consistent Format**
- All use markdown
- All request structured output
- All provide context

### ‚úÖ **Safety Considerations**
- Flags sensitive content
- Sanitizes tips for privacy
- Generic fallbacks for people/faces

## üöÄ **Summary**

**3 Prompts are sent to AFM:**

1. **"Analyze Attached Image"** ‚Üí Get image interpretation
2. **"Generate Caption"** + interpretation ‚Üí Get 3-5 word caption
3. **"Judge User Caption"** + both captions + rubric ‚Üí Get score & tips

**All prompts:**
- ‚úÖ Use markdown formatting
- ‚úÖ Request structured JSON output
- ‚úÖ Include clear examples
- ‚úÖ Specify constraints (word counts, formats)
- ‚úÖ Build on previous stage results

**Files:**
- `AFMJudge.swift` - Builds prompts
- `AFMService.swift` - Sends prompts to AI
- `AFMModels.swift` - Defines response structures
