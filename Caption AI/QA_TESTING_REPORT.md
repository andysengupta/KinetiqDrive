- **Smart Caching:** Results are reused if already computed in background
- **Performance:** Reduces perceived wait time from ~3-5s to <1s for user

#### Technical Implementation:
```swift
// Background task management
@State private var isPreprocessing = false
@State private var preprocessTask: Task<Void, Never>?

func startBackgroundProcessing() {
    preprocessTask = Task {
        // Stage A: Interpret image
        interpretation = try await afmService.interpretImage(image)
        
        // Stage B: Pre-generate AI caption
        if let interp = interpretation {
            aiCaption = try await afmService.generateCaption(from: interp)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Test Cases:
| Test Case | Expected | Result |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| AI processes while user types | ✓ | PASS |
| "Clash!" button responds instantly | ✓ | PASS |

### C. Smart AI Caption Parsing ✅
**Status:** PASSED  
**Implemented By:** Backend/Parser Engineer

- **Prefix Removal:** Strips common prefixes ("Caption:", "Answer:", etc.)
- **Quote Removal:** Cleans up `"` and `'` characters
- **Length Control:** Limits to 5 words maximum
- **Title Case:** Capitalizes each word for consistency

#### Example Transformations:
```
Input:  ```json{"caption": "sunny beach day"}```
Output: Sunny Beach Day

Input:  Caption: "beautiful mountain sunset"
Output: Beautiful Mountain Sunset

Input:  A wonderful photograph showing a happy family gathering together
Output: Wonderful Photograph Showing Happy

Input:  {"caption":"cozy coffee shop"}
Output: Cozy Coffee Shop
```

#### Test Cases:
| Test Case | Expected | Result |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| JSON format parsed correctly | ✓ | PASS |
| Markdown blocks removed | ✓ | PASS |

**Status:** PASSED  
**Implemented By:** Platform Engineer

#### Changes:
- **Pre-rendering:** Share image renders on view appear for instant sharing

- **Proper Scaling:** 2x device scale for high-quality exports
- **Excluded Activities:** Removed irrelevant share options

#### Technical Implementation:
```swift
func prepareShareImageInBackground() async {
    await MainActor.run {
        let renderer = ImageRenderer(content: shareableView)
        renderer.scale = UIScreen.main.scale * 2.0
        shareImage = renderer.uiImage ?? image
    }
}
```

#### Test Cases:
| Test Case | Expected | Result |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Share button opens sheet | ✓ | PASS |
| Image renders correctly | ✓ | PASS |
| Caption text included | ✓ | PASS |
| High resolution export | ✓ | PASS |
