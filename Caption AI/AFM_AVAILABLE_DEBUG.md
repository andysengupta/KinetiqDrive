# AFM is Available - Debug Next Steps

## ✅ **AFM Status Confirmed**

```
🔍 [AFM AVAILABILITY CHECK]
   Device compatible: true
   SystemLanguageModel availability: available
   ✅ AFM Available and Ready
   Final isAvailable: true
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Your device supports Apple Intelligence
- ✅ AFM is ready to use
- ✅ Should be using REAL captions (not mock)
- ✅ Should be using REAL judgments (not 7/10 default)

---

## 🔍 **Next: Trace Why Fallbacks Still Occur**

Since AFM is available but you're still seeing fallback captions and 7/10 scores, the issue is likely:

### **Scenario A: AFM Responds But Parsing Fails**
AFM returns data but our parsing can't extract it properly.

### **Scenario B: AFM Errors During Generation**
AFM tries to generate but encounters an error.

### **Scenario C: Response is Malformed**
AFM returns unexpected format.

---

## 📋 **What to Search For in Console**

Please search for these patterns and share what you find:

### **1. Caption Generation Flow**
```bash
Search: "📝 [CAPTION GENERATION START]"
```

**Expected (since AFM is available):**
```
📝 [CAPTION GENERATION START]
   AFM Available: true
   Interpretation: objects=ear, face, skin
📤 Sending caption prompt to AFM...
   Prompt length: 257 chars
📥 AFM Caption Response received
   Raw content: '[actual response from AFM]'
🔍 Parsing AI Caption - Raw input: '[response]'
✅ Extracted from JSON: '[caption]'
✅ Final cleaned caption: '[caption]'
🎨 [CAPTION GENERATION END]
   Final AI Caption: '[caption]'
   Caption length: X chars, Y words
```

**Look for:**
- Does it show "AFM Available: true"? ✅
- Does it say "📤 Sending caption prompt"? (Should see this)
- Does it show "📥 AFM Caption Response received"? (Look for this)
- What's in "Raw content"? (CRITICAL - this is what AFM returned)
- Does parsing succeed?
- Is there an "❌ AFM Caption Error"? (Would indicate a problem)

---

### **2. Judgment/Scoring Flow**
```bash
Search: "⚖️ [JUDGING START]"
```

**Expected (since AFM is available):**
```
⚖️ [JUDGING START]
   AFM Available: true
   User Caption: '[your caption]'
   AI Caption: '[AI caption]'
📤 Sending judgment prompt to AFM...
   Prompt length: 432 chars
📥 AFM Judgment Response received
   Raw content: '{"score":6,"shortTips":[...],"categories":[...]}'
🔍 Parsing judgment response...
✅ Successfully parsed judgment: score=6
⚖️ [JUDGING END]
   Final Score: 6/10
   Tips: [...]
   Categories: [...]
```

**Look for:**
- Does it show "AFM Available: true"? ✅
- Does it say "📤 Sending judgment prompt"? (Should see this)
- Does it show "📥 AFM Judgment Response received"? (Look for this)
- What's in "Raw content"? (CRITICAL - this is AFM's score)
- Does parsing succeed?
- What's the "Final Score"? (Should NOT be 7)
- Is there an "❌ AFM Judge Error"? (Would indicate a problem)

---

### **3. Check for Errors**
```bash
Search: "❌"
```

This will show all errors. Look for:
- "❌ AFM Caption Error: [error details]"
- "❌ AFM Judge Error: [error details]"
- Any other error messages

---

### **4. Check What User Sees**
```bash
Search: "🎯 [SCOREVIEW RENDER]"
```

**Should show:**
```
🎯 [SCOREVIEW RENDER]
   Judgment Score: X/10
   User Caption: '[your caption]'
   AI Caption (raw): '[AI caption]'
   Winner: [user/ai/tie]
```

**Compare:**
- What's the "Judgment Score"? (Is it 7 or something else?)
- What's the "AI Caption (raw)"? (Is it fallback text or real caption?)

---

## 🎯 **Most Likely Issues**

Since AFM is available but fallbacks are being used:

### **Issue 1: AFM Responds with Unexpected Format**
```
📥 AFM Caption Response received
   Raw content: 'Some text that is not JSON'
```

**Solution:** Parsing needs to be more flexible, or prompt needs adjustment.

---

### **Issue 2: AFM Errors During Generation**
```
📤 Sending caption prompt to AFM...
❌ AFM Caption Error: [timeout/network/whatever]
🤖 Fallback Mock Caption: 'Interesting Image'
```

**Solution:** Check the error. May be temporary or need retry logic.

---

### **Issue 3: Parsing Fails**
```
📥 AFM Caption Response received
   Raw content: '{"caption":"Close Ear Detail"}'
🔍 Parsing AI Caption - Raw input: '{"caption":"Close Ear Detail"}'
⚠️ Caption still malformed: '{', using fallback
```

**Solution:** Parsing logic has a bug. Need to fix extraction.

## 📱 **Action Items**

### **Step 1: Get Caption Generation Trace**
1. Clear console
2. Play one round
3. Search for `"CAPTION GENERATION START"`
4. Copy everything from that line until `"CAPTION GENERATION END"` (or until next section)
5. **Share the complete output**

### **Step 2: Get Judgment Trace**
1. Same round (don't clear console)
2. Search for `"JUDGING START"`
3. Copy everything from that line until `"JUDGING END"` (or until next section)
4. **Share the complete output**

### **Step 3: Check for Errors**
1. Search for `"❌"`
2. Share any error messages you find

## 🔍 **Example of What We Need**

```
📝 [CAPTION GENERATION START]
   AFM Available: true
   Interpretation: objects=ear, face, skin
📤 Sending caption prompt to AFM...
   Prompt length: 257 chars
📥 AFM Caption Response received
   Raw content: '[SHOW US THIS - this is critical!]'
🔍 Parsing AI Caption - Raw input: '[THIS TOO]'
[... rest of parsing output ...]
🎨 [CAPTION GENERATION END]
   Final AI Caption: '[WHAT ENDS UP HERE?]'
```

## 🎯 **Questions to Answer**

Based on the console output, we need to know:

1. **Does AFM actually respond?**
   - Look for "📥 AFM Caption Response received"
   - Look for "📥 AFM Judgment Response received"

2. **What does AFM return?**
   - Look at "Raw content:" lines
   - Is it JSON? Plain text? Empty?

3. **Does parsing succeed?**
   - Look for "✅ Extracted from JSON"
   - Look for "✅ Successfully parsed"
   - Or do you see "⚠️" warnings?

4. **What's the final output?**
   - "Final AI Caption:" - Is it real or fallback?
   - "Final Score:" - Is it varied or always 7?

5. **Are there any errors?**
   - Look for "❌" emoji
   - Check error messages

## 🚀 **Expected vs Actual**

### **If Everything Works (Expected):**
```
AFM Available: true
    ↓
📤 Sending prompts
    ↓
📥 Receiving responses with real data
    ↓
✅ Parsing succeeds
    ↓
🎨 Final AI Caption: "Close Ear Detail"
⚖️ Final Score: 6/10 (or other varied score)
    ↓
🎯 SCOREVIEW shows real caption and score
```

### **What's Happening (Actual):**
```
AFM Available: true
    ↓
📤 Sending prompts
    ↓
[??? Something goes wrong here ???]
    ↓
🤖 Fallback caption: "Captured Moment"
🤖 Fallback score: 7/10
```

**We need to find the ??? part!**

## 💡 **Tips for Sharing Output**

1. **Use Xcode Console filter:**
   - Type `CAPTION GENERATION` in filter bar
   - Shows only caption-related logs

2. **Copy multiple sections:**
   - Select text in console
   - Cmd+C to copy
   - Paste into a text file or here

3. **Look for patterns:**
   - 📝 = Starting a process
   - 📤 = Sending to AFM
   - 📥 = Receiving from AFM
   - ✅ = Success
   - ⚠️ = Warning/fallback
   - ❌ = Error

4. **Share "Raw content" lines:**
   - These show exactly what AFM returned
   - Critical for debugging!

**Please share the console output for caption generation and judgment, and we'll find exactly where things go wrong!** 🔍
